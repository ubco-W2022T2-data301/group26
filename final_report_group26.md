# Milestone 6 

## Introduction: 

Having come from football playing countries, the three of us have always watched the sport and grown into enthusiasts. Due to this common liking for football, we chose to team up for our data project and dig deeper to work on questions we have always been curious about. It is closely followed and the slightest changes make a difference in team and player valuations. To discover connections between factors and lower the related risk and ambiguity when concluding deals, data analysis is extremely important. In our project we tried to find out correlations between a player's performance of xG and xA (expected assists) to actual results of the matches. We also identified players who performed better or worse than average as well as their overall efficiency thanks to our study's ability to compare xG to actual goals scored and xA to actual assists. Finally, we also compared G to xG, A to xA, xG to xG per 90, and xA as extra criteria.


## Exploratory Data Analysis 

In our exploratory data analysis, we explored correlations between several variables which we have defined below. 
Variables:
- G = the number of goals players actually score throughout the season.
- xG = the number of goals that a player is expected to score based on the chances he has received.
- G - xG = the difference shows how much the expectation deviates from reality.
- xG90 = expected Goals per 90 minutes
- A = the number of assists player earned throughout the season
- xA = the number of assists that a player is expected to earned based on his passes
- A - xA = the difference shows how much the expectation deviates from reality.
- xA90 = expected Assists per 90 minutes

An important visualization from our EDA is the scatter plot showing dependency between xG and G. For this plot, we chose to use linear regression to analyze the dependency of the two variables and it turned out to have a linear result, which shows that actual goals are very much correlated to expected numbers and as one of the variables increases, the other will increase too. 

** PLOT 2 

This is an interesting plot to analyze because it shows the Expected Goals per 90 minutes data for all the players who have played in the Premier League for the 2021-2022 season AFTER weâ€™ve filtered outliers. The data seems pretty consistent which is far from what it was initially.


## Research Question 1: 

RQ: What is the correlation between G, xG, and G-xG? 

The correlation between G and xG shows how efficient players and teams were in converting their scoring chances into actual goals. If there is a positive correlation between the two variables then the players are efficiently meeting their target. On the other hand, if there is a weak or negative correlation, it could indicate that the player or team is struggling to convert their chances into goals. To find out the answer to this research question, we carried out exploratory data analysis and found that G and xG are very closely related. This is evident in the two plots provided below. 

** PLOT 3 

From the plot above, it is evident that G and XG have a positive linear correlation as G increases when XG increases. Also, most data points for G-XG are clustered between -2.5 to 2.5, except a few outliers, and have little to no proportionality. This is because G and XG are similar and therefore have little difference.  


** PLOT 4 

The second plot shows that teams that had many players meet their expected goals or over achieve finished higher in terms of the total number of goals and teams that had players with higher G and XG also finished higher in general. For example, Manchester City had several players who met their expected goals on the higher end and made the team accumulate more points. Liverpool, on the other hand, ended up second place because it had one of the highest scoring players and other players on the lower end who almost met their expected values. Even though these teams ended in top positions, they were expected to do slightly better. This is evident in the plot with the negative G-XG for the two teams. 

In conclusion, there is linear dependency between G and xG. If a player has high XG, chances are that his actual goals would also be high and the team of this player would also finish higher. Additionally, if the difference between G and xG is more than 0 then the player is said to have over achieved. If the difference is 0, then the player has just met their target. Finally, if the difference is negative, then the player has not quite met the target. 


## Research Question 2: 

The second research question that we were working with was about A, xA and xA-A i.e. finding correlation and coherency present in the datasheet about Assists, Expected Assists and the difference between them. What Assists dictate is the pass given to a player right before the goal. To elaborate, when a player shoots for a goal, the ball he receives from a pass from a different player acts as an assist for the game. Expected Assists are basically the expectations of a certain player in Assisting with the goal. The criteria (xA-A) gives us the insight about the overall performance of the player, if his performance was true to his data ( both real and expected), if he overachieved or underachieved at his criteria. If the value resulting from xA-A is 0, it means that his Assists and Expected Assists are true to his datasheet. If the value from xA-A is a positive integer, it means that he underachieved or underperformed in his criteria. But, if the value from xA-A is a negative integer, it means that he overachieved or over performed. From the overall Data Analysis, it was evidently clear that A and xA was pretty much similar. The real analytical data came from the difference of xA and A i.e. xA-A.
