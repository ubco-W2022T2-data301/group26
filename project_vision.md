# Project Vision
Soccer is the most popular sport in today’s world. Its enormous fan base presents a wealth of economic and risk prospects, necessitating extensive data analysis to reduce risk and ambiguity while closing deals. With the help of our project, we hope to learn if there is a correlation between a player's overperformance of xG (anticipated goals) and a different player's overperformance of xA (expected assists) on the same team. Our study will allow us to compare xG to actual goals scored and xA to actual assists in order to identify players who performed better than average or poorly than average as well as their overall efficiency. Some additional criteria we'll use is comparing G to xG, A to xA, xG to xG per 90, xA to xA per 90. Moreover, if we find some relativity between a player overperforming xG and a player on the same team is overperforming his xA, we will be able to prove that the assist metric is dependent on the player’s teammate's efficiency, and is therefore not as reliable a metric to compare players in comparison to xA.
