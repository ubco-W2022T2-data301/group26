# Project Vision
Soccer is the most popular sport in todayâ€™s world. Its enormous fan base presents a wealth of economic and risk prospects, necessitating extensive data analysis to reduce risk and ambiguity while closing deals. With the help of our project, we hope to learn if there is a correlation between a player's overperformance of xG (anticipated goals) and a different player's overperformance of xA (expected assists) on the same team. Our study will allow us to compare xG to actual goals scored and xA to actual assists in order to identify players who performed better than average or poorly than average as well as their overall efficiency. Some additional criteria we'll use is comparing G to xG, A to xA, xG to xG per 90, xA to xA per 90.
